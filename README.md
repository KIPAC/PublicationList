# PublicationList

Python and LaTeX code for preparing KIPAC's annual publication list. 

At the moment, it depends on a Google spreadsheet of institute members, whose URL must be supplied.
You'll also need ADS Bumblebee credentials, and to `pip install ads` and `pip install bibtexparser`.

Here's the main **Jupyter notebook** that does the work (coming soon!).
