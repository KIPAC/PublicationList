# PublicationList

Python and LaTeX code for preparing KIPAC's annual publication list. 

At the moment, it depends on a Google spreadsheet of institute members, whose URL must be supplied.
You'll also need ADS Bumblebee credentials (see instructions [here](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api#access), and to `pip install ads` and `pip install bibtexparser`.

Here's the [2015-2016 Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/KIPAC/PublicationList/blob/2015-2016/Publication%20List%202015-16.ipynb) that did all the work for the 2016 Annual Report. (We are still figuring out how to merge back into master).
